Yeah, so... After I heard the dinos went missing, I remembered that I saw Jory go back to the recording space.
S-so I went back there to search his backpack for the dinos.
I first searched the front pocket, where I saw the coins in the bag.
But when I saw they weren't there, I, uh... I turned the backpack to check the side pocket! Yeah!
When I opened up the left side pocket, that's where I found the dinosaurs! Y-yes, that's exactly how it happened!
